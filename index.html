            <h2>Ford Focus ST</h2>
            <p>
                The Ford Focus ST is a great choice for a new or used car 
                and is probably my first choice when its time for me to get my 
                next car. The car comes naturally with over 250 bhp and has a ton
                of aftermarket materials to add to the car. The pros of owning 
                this car are the price for the power, the overall look of the 
                vehicle and the fact that you can mod the car very easily and 
                there are many sites with how to videos on how to do so. The cons 
                are that it is only front wheel drive and its hard to find one
                with low miles for a low price.

            <h2>Ford Fiesta ST</h2>
            <p>
                The Ford Fiesta ST is another great choice when it 
                comes to me buying my next car. In all honesty it is 
                basically just a smaller version of the Focus ST. The 
                pros to this car are; it is cheaper than the Focus ST and
                easier to find one with low miles. However, the cons are; 
                it is less powerful than the Focus ST and also doesn't look 
                as nice in my opinion.

            <h2>Subaru WRX</h2>
            <p>
                The Subaru WRX, while not being my first pick
                when it comes to buying a new car, would be my
                favorite car of the three to obtain. Its pros are 
                the fact that its all-wheel drive and is slightly 
                more powerful than the Focus ST. However, its cons are 
                its price and fuel economy.
